# Snake

Welcome to my snake game!

Aim: Grow the snake as much as you can by eating the apples that appear in random locations on the screen. If you bump into the edge or into your own body, it's game over. Try to get the highest score possible!

Controls:

- Press space to start the game
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake

Note:

If you would like to see what happens when you beat the game (i.e. by the snake filling the whole grid) then you can go into the code and remove the commented out area titled as "AI". To make it beat the game faster, you can increase the clock tick speed at the very bottom of the code.
